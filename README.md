## ### üöó Android Auto Integration Setup

For developers looking to work on or understand the Android Auto integration for CarDash, the following manifest configurations are crucial for the app to be recognized and run correctly on an Android Auto unit (including the Desktop Head Unit - DHU):

1.  **`AndroidManifest.xml` Core Components:**

    *   **Uses Library:** Declare that the app uses the `androidx.car.app` library. It's recommended to set `android:required="false"` to allow installation on devices without the Android Auto framework, which simplifies development and testing of the phone app components.
        ```xml
        <application ...>
            <uses-library android:name="androidx.car.app" android:required="false"/>
            ...
        </application>
        ```

    *   **Car App Service:** This service is the entry point for Android Auto.
        *   It must be exported.
        *   It needs an intent filter for the `androidx.car.app.CarAppService` action.
        *   It requires a category declaration (e.g., `androidx.car.app.category.IOT` for an Internet of Things type app, which suits CarDash).
        ```xml
        <service
            android:name=".services.auto.CarDashCarAppService"  
            android:exported="true"
            android:label="@string/app_name">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="androidx.car.app.CarAppService" />
                <category android:name="androidx.car.app.category.IOT" />
            </intent-filter>
        </service>
        ```

    *   **Application-Level Meta-Data:**
        *   **Automotive App Description:** This links to an XML file (typically `res/xml/automotive_app_desc.xml`) that declares the app uses automotive templates.
            ```xml
            <application ...>
                ...
                <meta-data
                    android:name="com.google.android.gms.car.application"
                    android:resource="@xml/automotive_app_desc" />
                ...
            </application>
            ```
        *   **Minimum Car API Level:** This declares the minimum version of the Car App Library the app is compatible with.
            ```xml
            <application ...>
                ...
                <meta-data
                    android:name="androidx.car.app.minCarApiLevel"
                    android:value="1" />
                ...
            </application>
            ```

2.  **`res/xml/automotive_app_desc.xml`:**
    This file is referenced by the `com.google.android.gms.car.application` meta-data in the manifest. It must declare that the app uses templates.
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <automotiveApp>
        <uses name="template" />
    </automotiveApp>
    ```

Ensuring these elements are correctly configured is the first step to getting your Android Auto app recognized by the system and appearing in the launcher on the head unit.

3.  **Enabling Developer Mode for Android Auto (On Phone):**
    To test your app, including on the Desktop Head Unit (DHU), you need to enable developer mode in the Android Auto application on your phone:
    *   Open the Android Auto app on your phone.
    *   Go to **Settings**.
    *   Scroll down to the **Version** number and tap it repeatedly (usually 7-10 times) until you see a toast message saying "Developer mode enabled" or a dialog asking to enable developer settings.
    *   Once enabled, you can access developer settings via the three-dot menu (‚ãÆ) in the top-right corner of the Android Auto settings screen. This is where you can enable "Unknown sources" to run development builds from Android Studio and start the Head Unit Server for DHU.

4.  **Testing with the Desktop Head Unit (DHU):**
    The DHU allows you to simulate an Android Auto head unit on your development machine.
    *   **Install DHU:** If you haven't already, download the DHU from the Android Studio SDK Manager. It's typically found under "SDK Tools" -> "Android Auto Desktop Head Unit emulator".
    *   **Enable Head Unit Server:** In the Android Auto app's developer settings on your phone (see step 3), enable "Start head unit server".
    *   **Connect Phone:** Connect your phone to your computer via USB.
    *   **Start DHU:**
        *   On **macOS/Linux**, navigate to `~/Library/Android/sdk/extras/google/auto/` (macOS) or `~/Android/Sdk/extras/google/auto/` (Linux) in your terminal and run `desktop-head-unit`.
        *   On **Windows**, navigate to `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\extras\google\auto\` in Command Prompt or PowerShell and run `desktop-head-unit.exe`.
    *   The DHU should launch and connect to your phone, allowing you to see and test your CarDash app as it would appear on a car screen.
